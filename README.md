# Bit-Chain Integrity

Minimal bit-level integrity chain demonstration.

This repository contains a very small conceptual model:
a chain of blocks where each block’s integrity depends on the previous one.

It is NOT:

- a blockchain
- a cryptocurrency
- a production system
- a networked application

It is a conceptual integrity primitive.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the simplest possible form of linked integrity, where a single bit-level change breaks the chain.

This concept is intended to serve as a foundational idea for integrity-first verification architectures.

## Status

Minimal conceptual demo.

- No external dependencies
- No networking
- No persistence
- Just integrity
